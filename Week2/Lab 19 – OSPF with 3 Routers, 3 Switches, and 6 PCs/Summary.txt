Objective:

To build and verify an OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) network across multiple routers and LANs, demonstrating dynamic routing, subnetting, and end-to-end connectivity.

 Topology Overview:

Routers: 3 (R1, R2, R3)

Switches: 3 (One switch per router)

PCs: 6 total (2 PCs connected to each switch/router)

Connections:

Each router is connected to one switch.

Each switch has 2 PCs connected to it.

Routers are interconnected in a triangle topology using serial links.

 Configuration Details:

IP Addressing:

Each LAN segment (switch-PC subnet) is assigned a unique subnet.

Serial links between routers are also configured with /30 subnets.

OSPF Configuration:

Area OSPF (area 0) used between in router 1.

Area OSPF (area 1) used in router 0.

Area OSPF (area 2) used in router 2.

Verification:

PC-to-PC Connectivity:

PCs in different subnets can successfully ping each other through OSPF.

Routing Table Checks:

show ip route ospf confirms dynamic route learning.

OSPF Neighbor Status:

show ip ospf neighbor confirms adjacency establishment between routers.

Ping & Traceroute:

Tools used to validate path and latency between endpoints.

 Learning Outcomes:

Practical experience configuring OSPF on a multi-router network.

Reinforced understanding of routing tables, network masks, and inter-router communication.

Demonstrated how dynamic routing protocols enable scalable network design.



network statements include both LAN and WAN interfaces.

Verified OSPF adjacency and route propagation between routers.
