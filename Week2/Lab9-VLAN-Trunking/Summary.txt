Objective:
Demonstrate VLAN segmentation across two switches using trunking. Verify communication between devices in the same VLAN located on different switches.

Topology:

2x Cisco 2960 Switches

4x PCs (2 in VLAN 10, 2 in VLAN 20)

Switch-to-Switch Trunk Link using Fast Ethernet

Copper straight-through cables from PCs to switches

VLAN Configuration:

VLAN 10: PC0, PC2 (brown group)

VLAN 20: PC1, PC3 (red group)

IP Scheme (per VLAN, using /24):

VLAN 10:

PC0 – 192.168.10.2

PC2 – 192.168.10.3

VLAN 20:

PC1 – 192.168.20.2

PC3 – 192.168.20.3

Switch Configuration (example for VLAN 10 & trunk):

vlan 10
 name HR
vlan 20
 name Sales

interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

interface fa0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20

interface fa0/3
 switchport mode trunk
Results:

Devices in VLAN 10 can communicate (PC0 ↔ PC2)

Devices in VLAN 20 can communicate (PC1 ↔ PC3)

Devices from different VLANs cannot communicate (as expected)

Trunking successfully enables inter-switch communication for same-VLAN traffic.
