Objective:
Configure a DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses and verify that client PCs can successfully use domain names for communication.

Topology:

1x Cisco 2811 Router

1x 2960 Switch

1x DNS Server

3x PCs

Copper straight-through cables

IP Scheme (using /24 subnet):

PC0: 192.168.10.11

PC1: 192.168.10.12

PC2: 192.168.10.13

DNS Server: 192.168.10.2

Default Gateway (Router): 192.168.10.1

Router Configuration:

interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

Switch Configuration:
All devices were connected to the switch and remained in the default VLAN 1.

DNS Server Configuration (under Services > DNS):

DNS Service: ON

Added Record:

Name: www.ccna.local

Type: A Record

Address: 192.168.10.10

PC Configuration:

Each PC was manually assigned an IP address in the same subnet.

DNS Server was set to 192.168.10.2

Default Gateway set to 192.168.10.1

Results:

All PCs successfully resolved www.ccna.local to 192.168.10.10 using the DNS server.

Ping to domain name worked once connectivity was ensured.

Verified correct DNS mapping and end-to-end domain-based communication.
