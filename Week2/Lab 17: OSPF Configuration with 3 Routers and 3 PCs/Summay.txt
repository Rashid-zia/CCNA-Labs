Objective:
To design and implement an OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol over a network topology consisting of 3 routers connected in a triangular structure with 1 PC connected to each router.

Network Topology:
Routers: 3 Cisco routers (R1, R2, R3)

PCs: 3 end devices (PC1, PC2, PC3), each connected to one router

Links: Serial or FastEthernet connections between routers

IP Scheme: Different subnets for each router-PC segment and inter-router links

Key Configurations:
IP Addressing:

Each interface was assigned a unique IP in a /24 subnet.

PCs configured with appropriate default gateways.

Routing Protocol:

OSPF configured with:

router ospf 1

network <IP> <wildcard> area 0 

network <IP> <wildcard> area 1 

network <IP> <wildcard> area 2

All routers placed in Area 0.

Connectivity Testing:

Ping tests performed from each PC to all others.

Routing tables verified using show ip route.
