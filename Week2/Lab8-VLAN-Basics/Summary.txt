Objective:
Configure multiple VLANs on a switch, assign ports to different VLANs, and verify communication within and across VLANs.

Topology:

1x Cisco 2960 Switch

4x PCs (PC0–PC3)

Copper straight-through cables

VLAN Configuration:

VLAN 10 → HR Department (PC0, PC1)

VLAN 20 → Finance Department (PC2, PC3)

Switch Configuration:

vlan 10
 name HR

vlan 20
 name Finance

interface range fa0/1 - 2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

interface range fa0/3 - 4
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20

Test Results:
PC0 and PC1 (VLAN 10): Should ping successfully

PC2 and PC3 (VLAN 20): Should ping successfully

PC0 and PC2: Ping will fail (VLANs are isolated by design)
