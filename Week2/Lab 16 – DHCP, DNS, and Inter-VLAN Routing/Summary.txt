Summary:
In this lab, I configured a multi-VLAN network with DHCP and DNS services across two routers (HQ and Branch), simulating an enterprise-level network topology. The key objectives were to automate IP address assignment, enable name resolution, and ensure inter-VLAN communication.

Key Tasks Performed:

Created and assigned multiple VLANs (VLAN 10, 20, 30 on HQ; VLAN 40, 50, 60 on Branch).

Configured DHCP pools on the HQ router to dynamically assign IPs to VLAN interfaces.

Used router-on-a-stick to enable Inter-VLAN Routing using sub-interfaces.

Established serial communication between HQ and Branch routers using 10.0.0.1/24 and 10.0.0.2/24.

Set up a DNS server (192.168.10.10) and verified name resolution from client PCs.

Ensured all PCs in different VLANs successfully obtained IP addresses via DHCP and could ping each other and resolve DNS names.

Skills Practiced:

DHCP configuration across VLANs

Inter-VLAN routing using sub-interfaces

DNS client-server communication

Multi-router setup with routing protocols

Troubleshooting Layer 2/Layer 3 issues
