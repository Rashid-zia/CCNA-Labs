Objective:
Enable communication between multiple VLANs using a single router interface with sub-interfaces configured for each VLAN (Router-on-a-Stick method).

Topology:

1x Cisco 2811 Router

1x Cisco 2960 Switch

3x PCs in separate VLANs

Copper straight-through cables for PCs

Trunk link from switch to router

Switch Configuration:

vlan 10
 name HR
vlan 20
 name IT
vlan 30
 name Sales

interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

interface fa0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20

interface fa0/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 30

interface fa0/4
 switchport mode trunk

Router Configuration (Router-on-a-Stick):

interface fa0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

interface fa0/0.20
 encapsulation dot1Q 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0

interface fa0/0.30
 encapsulation dot1Q 30
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0

interface fa0/0
 no shutdown

Results:

All PCs in different VLANs can ping each other.

Inter-VLAN routing successfully enabled via sub-interfaces.

Router-on-a-Stick topology verified using trunk link.
