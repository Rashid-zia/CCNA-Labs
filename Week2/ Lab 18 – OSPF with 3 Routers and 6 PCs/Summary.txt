Objective:
To demonstrate OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol in a network topology with multiple routers and end devices.

Topology Overview:

Routers: 3 (R1, R2, R3)

Switches: Connected to each router

End Devices: 6 PCs (2 per router's network)

Routing Protocol: Multiple areas OSPF

Key Configurations:

Each router has a unique directly connected network.

OSPF is configured in area mode (area 1) in router o.

OSPF is configured in area mode (area 2) in router 2.

OSPF is configured in area mode (area 0) in between other two routers.

Network statements were used to advertise connected networks into OSPF.

Default routes are propagated as needed.

PCs are configured with IP addresses in the correct subnets and default gateways.

Verification:

Used ping and traceroute commands to verify inter-network communication.

Checked OSPF neighbor relationships using show ip ospf neighbor.

Verified OSPF routing table using show ip route ospf.

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding how OSPF dynamically shares routes between routers.

Verifying routing convergence and reachability across a multi-router network.

Understanding the importance of subnet planning and router interfaces.
