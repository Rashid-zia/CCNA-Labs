Objective:
Establish static routing between two routers connected via a serial link and enable communication between their respective LANs.

Topology:
2x Cisco 2811 Routers (Router0, Router1)
2x Cisco 2960 Switches
4x PCs (2 per LAN segment)
1x Serial DCE/DTE connection
Copper straight-through cables for LAN
Serial DCE cable for router-to-router connection

IP Scheme:
Router0 LAN:
PC0: 192.168.0.2 / Gateway: 192.168.0.1
PC1: 192.168.0.3 / Gateway: 192.168.0.1

Router1 LAN:
PC2: 192.168.1.2 / Gateway: 192.168.1.1
PC3: 192.168.1.3 / Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Serial Link (using /30):

Router0 Se0/3/0: 10.10.10.1
Router1 Se0/3/0: 10.10.10.2

Router Configuration (Router0):
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface se0/3/0
 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.252
 clock rate 64000
 no shutdown
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2

Router Configuration (Router1):
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface se0/3/0
 ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
ip route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1

Results:
Static routes correctly configured on both routers.
All PCs on both LANs can successfully ping each other.
Serial communication works using a /30 subnet for efficient IP usage.
Problem-solving included ensuring correct gateway and clock rate on DCE side.
