Objective
Establish connectivity between two remote networks using Serial communication between routers and configure RIP version 2 to enable dynamic routing.

Topology:
- 2 Routers (Cisco 2811)
- 2 Switches (2960)
- 4 PCs (2 per LAN side)
- Serial connection between routers
- Ethernet connections between routers, switches, and PCs

IP Scheme:
PC0 - 192.168.1.2 / Gateway: 192.168.1.1
PC1 - 192.168.1.3 / Gateway: 192.168.1.1
PC2 - 192.168.2.2 / Gateway: 192.168.2.1
PC3 - 192.168.2.3 / Gateway: 192.168.2.1
Router0: Fa0/0 - 192.168.1.1 | Serial0/3/0 - 10.0.0.1
Router1: Fa0/0 - 192.168.2.1 | Serial0/3/0 - 10.0.0.2

Router Configuration:
Router0:
interface fa0/0  
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0  
 no shutdown  
interface serial0/3/0  
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252  
 clock rate 64000  
 no shutdown  
router rip  
 version 2  
 no auto-summary  
 network 192.168.1.0  
 network 10.0.0.0  

Router1:
interface fa0/0  
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0  
 no shutdown  
interface serial0/3/0  
 ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252  
 no shutdown  
router rip  
 version 2  
 no auto-summary  
 network 192.168.2.0  
 network 10.0.0.0  

Results:

- All PCs across both LANs can successfully ping each other.
- RIP v2 dynamically advertises routes between both networks.
- Issue resolved by enabling interfaces, setting clock rate on DCE side, and configuring correct RIP networks and gateways.
