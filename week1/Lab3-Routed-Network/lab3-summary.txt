Lab 3 – Routed Multi-Subnet Network (HR, IT, Sales)

📌 Objective:
To create a routed network for three departments (HR, IT, Sales) using a Cisco 2811 router and physical FastEthernet interfaces without VLANs.

🧱 Topology:
- 1x Cisco 2811 Router (with NM-1FE-TX module)
- 3x Cisco 2960 Switches
- 6x PCs (2 for each department)
- Copper straight-through cables

🌐 Subnet Plan (/27):
HR:     192.168.1.0/27     Gateway: 192.168.1.1      PC: 192.168.1.10  
IT:     192.168.1.32/27    Gateway: 192.168.1.33     PC: 192.168.1.34  
Sales:  192.168.1.64/27    Gateway: 192.168.1.65     PC: 192.168.1.70

🛠 Router Configuration:
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.224
 no shutdown

interface fa0/1
 ip address 192.168.1.33 255.255.255.224
 no shutdown

interface fa1/0
 ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.224
 no shutdown

✅ Results:
- Successful ping between all departments
- Verified with PC4 → PC0
- All router ports and cables functioning correctly
