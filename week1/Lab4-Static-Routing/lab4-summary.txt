Lab 4 â€“ Static Routing: Single Router with Multiple Networks

Objective:
Configure a router to enable communication between three directly connected subnets using static routing principles.

Topology:
- 1x Cisco 2811 Router
- 3x PCs (one per subnet)
- 3x Fast Ethernet interfaces (one per subnet)
- Copper straight-through cables

IP Scheme (using /24):
PC0 - 192.168.10.2 / Gateway: 192.168.10.1  
PC1 - 192.168.20.2 / Gateway: 192.168.20.1  
PC2 - 192.168.30.2 / Gateway: 192.168.30.1  

Router Configuration:
interface fa0/0  
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0  
 no shutdown  

interface fa0/1  
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0  
 no shutdown  

interface fa1/0  
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0  
 no shutdown  

Results:
- All PCs can successfully ping each other.
- Static routes not required as all subnets are directly connected.
- Issue resolved by configuring correct default gateway on PCs.
