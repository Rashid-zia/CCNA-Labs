Objective:
Implement dynamic routing between two routers using RIP v2 to enable communication across multiple networks.

Topology:
2x Cisco 2811 Routers (Router0 and Router1)
2x Switches (one per LAN segment)
4x PCs (2 per subnet)
1x Serial Link between routers
Copper straight-through cables for PCs and switches
Serial DCE cable between routers

IP Scheme (using /24):
Router0 LAN:
PC0 – 192.168.10.2 / Gateway: 192.168.10.1
PC1 – 192.168.10.3 / Gateway: 192.168.10.1
Router0 Fa0/0 – 192.168.10.1
Router0 Serial0/3/0 – 10.0.0.1

Router1 LAN:
PC2 – 192.168.20.2 / Gateway: 192.168.20.1
PC3 – 192.168.20.3 / Gateway: 192.168.20.1
Router1 Fa0/0 – 192.168.20.1
Router1 Serial0/3/0 – 10.0.0.2

RIP Configuration (on both routers):
router rip  
version 2  
no auto-summary  
network 192.168.10.0  
network 192.168.20.0  
network 10.0.0.0
